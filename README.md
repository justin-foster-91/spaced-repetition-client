### Capstone Statement
This app is a spaced repetition learning program to aid in learning foreign language words. It allows users to access their dashboard where they will see the list of words and their current score.

They can then select to start practice, where they will be directed to the learning page where words will be presented to them one at a time. Each guess will tell them whether they were correct or incorrect, track their score progress, and direct them to try another word. The more times a user guessed the correct answer, the less often they will be shown that word.
